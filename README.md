# drl-learning
A repository sharing the literatures about deep reinforcement learning, including Q-value-based / policy-gradient-based model-free methods, and some model-based / multi-agent methods


## More to Learn

* This repo is a subtask track for my [ai-learning](https://github.com/Strivin0311/ai-learning) repo, where you can learn more technologies and applicated tasks about the whole AI full-stack
